Sankey Diagram – Documentation
=================================

Overview
--------
This Sankey diagram visualizes connections between organizations, thematic domains, and addressee groups.
It uses Plotly.js to show flows of relationships between entities. Each colored node represents an actor or category,
and each connecting line (link) shows the flow strength, determined by a numeric value.

Core Components
---------------

1. Plotly Initialization
   Uses Plotly’s CDN (https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.4.1.min.js) and renders the Sankey diagram inside a <div> container.

2. Data Structure
   - Nodes: represent organizations, domains, and target audiences.
   - Links: represent directional connections between nodes.

   Example:
   "node": {
     "label": ["América Latina y el Caribe Mejor Sin TLC", "COSPE ETS", ...],
     "color": ["#2E91E5","#E15F99","#1CA71C", ...],
     "pad": 28,
     "thickness": 18
   }

   "link": {
     "source": [0, 0, 1, ...],
     "target": [20, 22, 25, ...],
     "value": [4, 3, 5, ...]
   }

3. Layout Configuration
   Defines global aesthetics:
   - Font size and color
   - Margins
   - Background colors
   - Responsive layout for resizing

4. Visual Interpretation
   - Left nodes: organizations
   - Middle nodes: action domains (e.g., Democracy, Human Rights)
   - Right nodes: addressees (e.g., Media, Citizens, Institutions)
   - Thicker lines = stronger relationships or higher connection values.

User Interactions
-----------------
- Hovering over nodes or links shows tooltips with detailed info.
- The diagram automatically highlights connected paths on hover.
- The chart is fully responsive and adjusts to screen size.

Dependencies
------------
- Plotly.js v2.4.1 (loaded via CDN)
- No external dataset required; data is embedded in the JavaScript.

File Structure
--------------

Editing or Extending the Diagram
--------------------------------
1. Add new nodes:
   - Extend the "node.label" and "node.color" arrays.

2. Add new links:
   - Append new pairs to "link.source", "link.target", and matching "link.value".

3. Adjust layout:
   - Modify pad and thickness values for spacing and size.
   - Update arrangement or orientation settings for layout clarity.

4. Exporting:
   - Use the built-in Plotly toolbar to save as PNG or SVG.

Example Interpretation
----------------------
The Sankey shows how organizations such as COSPE ETS, VoxUkraine, or YUCOM connect across thematic domains
like Democracy, Human/Fundamental Rights, or Energy/Climate/Sustainability, and how these link to addressee groups
such as Media, Citizens, and EU institutions.

This visualization provides an overview of collaboration patterns and relational flows across multiple sectors.
