Gephi Network JSON + HTML Visualization – Documentation
===============================================================

Overview
--------
This documentation describes the structure of the Gephi-exported JSON file (`PrjAdd-2509.json`) and its visualization through the interactive HTML file using Sigma.js, Graphology, and ForceAtlas2.

1. JSON File Structure
----------------------
File: PrjAdd-2509.json
Origin: Gephi 0.10.1
Type: Directed multigraph

Sections:
- attributes: metadata (e.g. creator)
- options: graph type and layout options
- nodes: list of entities (nodes)
- edges: list of relations (edges)

Node Attributes:
- key: Unique node ID
- label: Display name
- x, y: Coordinates in 2D layout
- size: Node size (visual weight)
- color: Base color (can be overridden by HTML script)
- metaType: Node type (Country, Project, Organization, etc.)
- startYear, endYear: Temporal range for projects

Edge Attributes:
- key: Edge ID
- source / target: Linked node keys
- weight: Edge thickness
- relation: Type of connection (implements, engages, addresses, targets, impacts)

Special Notes:
- Projects include time ranges for timeline filtering.
- Relations represent different layers of connection across domains and actors.

2. HTML Visualization
---------------------
File: index.html (or hosted version at mimtat.github.io/VALEUs/)
Libraries: Sigma.js 3.0.2, Graphology 0.25.4, ForceAtlas2, NoOverlap

Core Steps:
1. JSON is fetched and parsed.
2. Color map assigns consistent colors by metaType.
3. Nodes are normalized so that similar types (e.g., “Research”, “Monitoring”) are grouped as “Kind of Action”.
4. Graph is initialized with nodes and edges.
5. ForceAtlas2 layout runs continuously for smooth visualization.

Color Mapping:
- Country: rgb(102, 255, 255)
- Project: rgb(255, 102, 102)
- Organization: rgb(102, 102, 255)
- Addressee: rgb(255, 255, 102)
- Action Domain: rgb(255, 102, 255)
- Kind of Action: rgb(102, 255, 102)

3. Controls and Interactivity
-----------------------------
Controls:
- Pause Layout: Toggles ForceAtlas2 animation.
- De-overlap: Activates NoOverlap to separate overlapping nodes.

Filters:
- Checkboxes toggle visibility by metaType.
- Projects cannot be disabled but are filtered dynamically by year.

Year Control:
- Slider range: 2010–2025.
- Displays only projects active within the selected year.

Reducers:
- nodeReducer hides nodes that fail filter or year condition.
- edgeReducer hides edges whose connected nodes are hidden.

4. Visual Semantics
-------------------
Category           | Role                        | Color
------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------
Country            | Geographic context           | Cyan
Organization       | Institutional actor          | Blue
Project            | Temporal connector           | Red
Addressee          | Audience / target            | Yellow
Action Domain      | Thematic area (e.g., Democracy) | Pink
Kind of Action     | Activity type                | Green

This structure visualizes “who connects with whom” through “what kind of project,” “in which thematic domain,” and “how (kind of action),” across time (year slider).

5. Editing or Extending
-----------------------
To add nodes or edges:
- Add new entries to “nodes” or “edges” arrays.
- Each node requires a unique “key” and defined “metaType”.
- Projects should include “startYear” and “endYear”.
- Save the JSON and reload it in the HTML directory.

6. Dependencies
---------------
Library                         | Purpose
-------------------------------- | ----------------------------
Sigma.js                        | Rendering and interaction
Graphology                      | Data structure and graph management
ForceAtlas2                     | Continuous layout simulation
NoOverlap                        | Collision avoidance

7. Hosting
----------
- The visualization can run locally or via GitHub Pages.
- JSON and HTML must reside in the same folder.
- No backend required.

Summary
-------
This system integrates Gephi-exported data into a dynamic, browser-based visualization that enables filtering, temporal analysis, and interactive exploration of relationships between organizations, projects, addressees, and thematic domains.
